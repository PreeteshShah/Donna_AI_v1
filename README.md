## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
DonnaAI is an innovative AI-powered planning tool designed to streamline the process of managing and consolidating events from multiple platforms into a single, unified calendar. With the growing number of communication channels and platforms people use dailyâ€”such as Gmail, Outlook, Discord, Slack, LinkedIn, and othersâ€”keeping track of important meetings, deadlines, and social events can become overwhelming. DonnaAI addresses this challenge by seamlessly integrating with these platforms, gathering event information, and creating a comprehensive, real-time calendar.
